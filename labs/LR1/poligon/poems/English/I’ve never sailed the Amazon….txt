I’ve never sailed the Amazon…
Rudyard Kipling

I've never sailed the Amazon, 
  I've never reached Brazil; 
But the Don and Magdalena, 
  They can go there when they will!

          	Yes, weekly from Southampton, 
          	Great steamers, white and gold, 
          	Go rolling down to Rio
          	(Roll down—roll down to Rio!) 
          	And I'd like to roll to Rio 
          	Some day before I'm old!

I've never seen a Jaguar, 
   Nor yet an Armadill
O dilloing in his armour, 
  And I s'pose I never will,

          	Unless I go to Rio
          	These wonders to behold
          	Roll down—roll down to Rio
          	Roll really down to Rio!
          	Oh, I'd love to roll to Rio 
          	Some day before I'm old!
